'''
Write a program that asks the user to enter the month (represented as a number in the range 1 through 12) and the year. The program should then display the number of days in that month. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:

Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not. Example: if the user enters 2 for the month and 2008 for the year, the program should say that month has 29 days.

In the comment below, provide five different possible test cases for this, as well as the expected output:
