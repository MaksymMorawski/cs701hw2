'''
You are making a really un-fun game of "pocket monster battles."  Users are asked to input the name and power level of two monsters, and their power levels.  The monster with the greater power level wins. You declare who the winner of their battle is.

If one monster is at least twice as powerful as the other, you state that monster is "super efficacious!"
