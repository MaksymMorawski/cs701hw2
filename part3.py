You are writing software to help people decide what to put in their fish tank.  You will prompt them for the type of fish that they want to buy, and then give them an answer that depends on the type of fish.  The three types of fish are "carnivorous" "salt water" and "community".

If they input carnivorous
Ask them "Do you have smaller fish already?"
If they answer "no"
print "Great!  Enjoy!"
If they answer "yes"
print "This is a bad idea!  It'll eat your little ones!"
If they input salt water
print "Wow, you're a fancy fish parent!"
If they input community
Ask them how many fish of that type they already have
If they have less than 3 already, print out that they should get more than one.  You do not need to check for negative numbers.
Otherwise, print out "Yay, more friends!"
If they put anything else for type
Print "I don't think that's a type of fish.  Maybe you're looking for a lizard?"
All of the user responses will be entirely lower case.  You do not need to worry about upper case in the responses.
