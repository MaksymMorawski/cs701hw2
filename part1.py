'''
Suppose a string variable season holds the current season, a float variable temperature holds the current temperature, and a boolean variable air_conditioner indicates if the air conditioner is on. Write a Python program that, if the season is "summer", then if the temperature is above 72 it should set air_conditioner to True and otherwise set it to False.'''
