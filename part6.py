'''
For this program, create a (very simplified) day of the week calculator. Ask the user to enter the day of the month, and respond with the correct day of the week. 

The program will assume that the month starts on Sunday and has 30 days (just like the month of September in 2019). The program
Can assume that the number entered will be an integer 
Cannot assume that the number entered will be valid! 

If the day of the month the user entered is not a valid day of the month (less than 1 or greater than 30), simply print a short error message to the user. Otherwise, print the day of the week that day falls on. For instance, the 2nd would be a Monday, the 10th would be a Tuesday, etc.
